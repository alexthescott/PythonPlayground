""" Question 1 - Fill in the blank response ------------------------------------------------
 List all of the basic data types in Python, and give examples of each type
-int, float, str, bool

 How can we convert an int into a string
-typecasting, like str(42) 

 List all 7 basic variable operators, and their functions (+, -, etc.)
- +, -, /, *, //, %, **

 List all 9 logical operators
- >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=, and, or, not

 List the two kinds of loops
- For Loops, While Loops

 When might we want a for loop instead of a while loop?
- While iterating across a string or a list, or we know the number of iterations

 When might we want a while loop instead of a for loop?
- While True, while we don't know the number of iterations, or a multi-case loop condition

 What are the two use cases of in
- Iterate across list/str, or check if elem in list/str. ex// For i in str... if char in 'aeiouAEIOU' 

 What is a list?
-collection of data stored sequentially, and without preference for a data type

 What is a tuple?
-colllection of immutable data stored sequentially, and without preference for a data type

 How do lists and tuples differ?
-lists are mutable, tuples are not. Lists have more functions available ex// list.append()

 How can we index a list?
-list[int]

 How can we slice a list/string, and what happens if we index a slice out of bounds?
-string[0:len(string)] by default. And yes we can index out of bounds on a slice

""" Question 3 - Function Definition -------------------------------------------""" """
 You show up to the midterm early, and want to go on a stroll. A block takes 1 minute to walk, and 
 you have 10 minutes until your midterm starts.

 Write a function which accepts a list arbitrary length. 
 The list will contain 'n', 's', 'e', 'w', the block directions you can travel.

 Only return true if we take a 10 minute stroll, and end up where we began 

 Hint: Think about how we can keep track of directions, and time elapsed. also list.count() is everything...

 ex//
 	midtermStroll(['n', 'n', 'e', 'w', 's', 's', 'e', 'e', 'w', 'w']) -> True
 	midtermStroll([n, n, e, w, s, s, e, e, s, s]) -> False

SOLUTION:

def midtermStroll(walk):
	return len(walk) == 10 and walk.count('n') == walk.count('s') and walk.count('e') == walk.count('w')

or

def midtermStroll(walk):
	if len(walk) == 10:
		if walk.count('n') == walk.count('s'):
			if walk.count('e') == walk.count('w'):
				return True
	return False

 You want to write a small program to find the two closest points given a plot on the x, y graph

 Write a function which accepts a list containing (x, y) tuples. Assume points are unique.
 Return a list of the two tuples closest to each other

 I encourage you to try to solve this problem on paper, with a list of your own creation. How can we compare
 every point to every other point without. You will need a well thought out nested loop

 ex//
 	closest_points([(1,2),(1,1),(3,7)]) == [(1,2),(1,2)]
 	closest_points([(1,2),(4,0),(5,3),(1,8),(4,5),(6,7)]) == [(4,5),(6,7)]

SOLUTION:
def closest_points(points):
	shortPoints = []
	dist = 0
	for i, p, in enumerate(points):
		for j, p, in enumerate(points):
			if i < j:
				xDist = p[0] - q[0]
				yDist = p[1] - q[1]
				tempDist = (xDist**2 + yDist**2)**(0.5)
				if dist == 0 or tempDist < dist:
					shortPoints = []
					shortPoints.extend([p,q])
	return shortPoints
"""

def midtermStroll(walk):
	if len(walk) == 10:
		if walk.count('n') == walk.count('s'):
			if walk.count('e') == walk.count('w'):
				return True
	return False

assert midtermStroll(['n', 'n', 'e', 'w', 's', 's', 'e', 'e', 'w', 'w']) == True

def closest_points(points):
	shortPoints = []
	dist = 0
	for i, p, in enumerate(points):
		for j, p, in enumerate(points):
			if i < j:
				xDist = p[0] - q[0]
				yDist = p[1] - q[1]
				tempDist = (xDist**2 + yDist**2)**(0.5)
				if dist == 0 or tempDist < dist:
					shortPoints = []
					shortPoints.extend([p,q])
	return shortPoints

assert(closest_points([(1,2),(4,0),(5,3),(1,8),(4,5),(6,7)]) == [(4,5),(6,7)])
